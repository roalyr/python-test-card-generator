# python-test-card-generator
This script generates random test cards from blocks of questions and saves them as a text file.

### How to
Just download and run it with Python3 after inserting questions into the question blocks:
`python3 ./Test_card_generator.py`

A small lifehack: use spreadsheets to organize questions, add `"` and `,` symbols, 
then copy question blocks to plain text editor and replace tabs with spaces and copy the result to the script.
